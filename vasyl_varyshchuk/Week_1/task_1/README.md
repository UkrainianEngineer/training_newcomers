Task Description

Prepare environment to make it possible to execute simple Python code.

It’s recommended to install `PyCharm` and configure it for yourself.
Also, it would be great to install `py.test` and setup it in PyCharm.

To make sure, everything is OK with `py.test` configuration write some very simple test using py.test.


Write a custom function which returns a maximum integer value from list of strings.

Input:
data = [“one”, “1”, “two”, “2”, “ten”, “10”, “15”, “-2”, “some long text goes here”, “16.9”, “&”]

Output:
get_max_value(data)   # Returns: 16

Note: It’s Ok that we’re not rounding float to int.


Write a few simple tests via py.test for the function above. It’s great to write a code in PyCharm and execute your tests via PyCharm.
